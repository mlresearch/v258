title: Performative Prediction on Games and Mechanism Design
software: https://github.com/antoniogois/performative-games
openreview: Qi9HokKRMu
abstract: Agents often have individual goals which depend on a group’s actions. If
  agents trust a forecast of collective action and adapt strategically, such prediction
  can influence outcomes non-trivially, resulting in a form of performative prediction.
  This effect is ubiquitous in scenarios ranging from pandemic predictions to election
  polls, but existing work has ignored interdependencies among predicted agents. As
  a first step in this direction, we study a collective risk dilemma where agents
  dynamically decide whether to trust predictions based on past accuracy. As predictions
  shape collective outcomes, social welfare arises naturally as a metric of concern.
  We explore the resulting interplay between accuracy and welfare, and demonstrate
  that searching for stable accurate predictions can minimize social welfare with
  high probability in our setting. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior
  model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism
  design.
